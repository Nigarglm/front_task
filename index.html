                    <p class="text"> <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> industry.
                        Lorem
                        Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy<br> text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                        printer took a galley<br>
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has<br> survived not only five
                        centuries,
                        but also the leap into electronic <br> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                        popularised in <br> the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> Ipsum
                        passages,
                        and more recently with desktop publishing <br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                        of
                        Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row2">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <p class="maintext">Why do we use it?</p>
                    <p class="text"> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>readable content of a
                        page
                        when looking at its layout. The point of<br> using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                        normal
                        distribution<br> of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',<br> making it
                        look like
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
                        as
                        their<br> default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover<br> many web sites
                        still in
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved<br> over the years, sometimes by accident,
                        sometimes on
                        purpose<br> (injected humour and the like). </p>

                <div class="col-6">
                    <p class="maintext">Where does it come from?</p>
                    <p class="text">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin<br> professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of<br> the more obscure
                        Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum<br> passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical<br> literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum<br> comes from sections
                        1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum<br> et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in<br> 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular<br> during
                        the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem<br> ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                        line in
                        section 1.10.32. </p>

                    <p class="maintext">Where can I get some?</p>
                    <p class="text"> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br> but the majority have
                        suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected<br> humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                        slightly<br>
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you<br> need to be sure there
                        isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the<br> middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet<br> tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the<br> first true
                        generator on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200<br> Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence<br> structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The<br> generated Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition,<br> injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
